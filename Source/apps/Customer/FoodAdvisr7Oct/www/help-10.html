To search for a restaurant, either allow FoodAdvisr to use your location when prompted or enter the
postcode/location you wish to search for. If you selected a specific cuisine, it will only show you
restaurants in that category.
<br/> <br/>
FoodAdvisr’s participating restaurants will appear at the top of the list. Restaurants with menu and meal
data available will be shown in colour. Non-participating restaurants will appear in grey. If you would like

restaurant right to favourite it or ‘swipe’ a restaurant left to delete it.

of the dishes.
<br/> <br/>
If a meal on the menu matches your nutritional requirements (either because of your profile or a selected
ingredient you have chosen to include), you will see a green square marked with a pulsating white
‘thumbs up’ (the FoodAdvisr logo!).
<br/> <br/>
If a meal does not match your nutritional requirements (either because of your profile or a selected
ingredient you have chosen to exclude), you will see a red square marked with a white exclamation mark.
<br/> <br/>
If a meal contains an allergen you have selected, you will see a black square marked with a white ‘A’ and
the meal will be greyed out. A black square marked 'May Contain' in white means the product may contain
an ingredient you are allergic to/chosen to avoid but will not be greyed out.
<br/> <br/>
Tap on the coloured coded square to see what ingredient has triggered the rating.
<br/> <br/>
You can either book a table through the app or call the restaurant directly.

<h4>Results screen</h4>
<h5>Results</h5>
A black square marked with a white 'A' means the product you have scanned contains an allergen and you must avoid it.
A black square marked 'may contain' in white means the product may contain an ingredient you are allergic/intolerant to, for example, 'may contain traces of nuts'.  A red square with a white exclamation mark means the product contains an ingredient you have excluded because you are intolerant to it, dislikeit or because it has been excluded as part of your selected pre-set profile.
<br/><br/>
A green pulsating square with a digital 'thumbs up' (our logo) means the item contains an ingredient you like and have selected to be included in your preferences.
<br/><br/>
Tap on the colour coded square to the right of the product to see why FoodAdvisr has been traffic lighted it that colour.  Red, amber and green ratings are given by comparing the item against the nutritional content for the pre-set profile you have selected – for example, a high sugar content item will show red if you have selected the Diabetes Friendly profile.
<br/><br/>
A grey box means that we do not hold the data for that product and therefore the comparison cannot be completed.
<br/><br/>

The 'Share' button above each result square enables you to share comments about this product - a chance to share your discovery.
